QUESTIONS
1. Are there known issues or functions that aren't working currently 
    in your attached code? If so, explain.
    
    --> Currently with our final version of the Server.py code, there 
        are no issues or functions that are not working correctly.

## 3. What problems did you face developing code for this project? 
    Around how long did you spend on this project.
        
        --> The only problem we faced initially was just familiarizing 
                ourselves with socket programming and it's 
                implementation in Python. This included learning about
                the socket object and how it makes low-level 
                (operating system-level) calls to imeplement its 
                functionality in Python. The urge to research the socket 
                class in Python and its familial functions was helpful!
        --> We spent around 3 days on this project. This included 
                reviewing necessary pre-requisites of Python 
                programming and sockets, collaboration, planning, 
                implementation, testing, and debugging.
